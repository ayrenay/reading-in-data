# Listening To: Data Stories Episode 8

[Podcast link](http://datastori.es/episode-8-interview-jeff-heer/)

I started listening to podcasts this year, and, naturally, I began back at the first episodes of a number of podcasts that I'd been "meaning to listen to" for a while:
- [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/)
- [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast)
- [Becoming a Data Scientist](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/podcast/)
- [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/)

I've been at it for a few months now, but I can't believe I waited so long to get into podcasts. They're so informative and a great way to engage with information and people I might never have otherwise come across.

This evening started with [Episode 8 of the Data Stories podcast](http://datastori.es/episode-8-interview-jeff-heer/), featuring Jeff Heer. I'd never heard of him by name before--but I've definitely heard of [his work](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) and the work of his students. After listening to this episode and doing a bit of research on Dr. Heer, I feel quite lucky to have gotten to enjoy this episode. I'm also following him on Twitter now ([@jeffrey_heer](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_heer)) and have added his [open syllabus for Data Visualization](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/) to my upcoming projects list. I can't wait to get started on that!

A few things that struck me from listening to this episode, and/or things that I learned:
- Seriously, I had no idea of how much impact Dr. Heer's had on programmatic data visualization, either through his own work or through students he's advised (ahem, including a certain one named Mike Bostock!)
- This episode helped bring together my understanding of the _language_ of data visualization (i.e. the grammar of graphics). I started learning about and getting a sense of this when I put together a short [Intro to D3 workshop](https://github.com/ayrenay/d3-rough-sketches-class) and started reading Hadley Wickham's [research paper that introduced ggplot2](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf). I was honestly blown away when I started grasping how this stuff comes together, and that was reinforced here. To that point: "D3 is a language- or grammar-based approach [to data visualization], albeit on a lower level"
- "There's a difference between time to master a tool and time necessary to put a tool into use." D3 takes a while to be usable, but it's faster to master than prior frameworks.
- "The most important thing in visualization [are] the features you choose to visualize." A particularly salient point coming off of a great project in my BI class where I made several rich, interesting visualizations that stood out from the others in the class due (in part) to the perspective I took on the underlying data (i.e. quantity sold as a percentage of profit, rather than gross quantity). I also find it notable coming off of some significant effort in the long-term modeling project that we did for my graduate school practicum. While we've been learning how critically important feature selection is to machine learning, I'd never previously made the connection that "feature selection", so to speak, is just as important in visualization.
- A reminder about [Explorable Explanations](http://explorabl.es/)
- Why has the population of data visualization exploded so much? A bunch of trends have all converged: the data, the audience, and the tools for access and communicating are all available for us to work with and access
- There was a lot of talk on viz as an exploratory tool. It culminated a bit in a discussion of the process of science versus the rhetoric of science, in that what you ultimately see in research papers doesn't show you the trail of failed ideas that got you there. Even though I don't conduct research or have any well-known projects attributed to me, that trail of (good/useful!) failure is very familiar. A solution that only takes so much time to put together once you've figured it out takes a long time to actually figure out.
- How do we use visualization (slash design) as an action device or a data gathering device? (a question/point by Jeff Heer)
- They were talking about research into perception and (re)evaluating how people interpret visualization. This (somehow) reminded me of a thought from another day: there is a very careful balance between what I understand as nice to look at/easy to use because I've trained myself to look at things a certain way and how other people may feel/interpret the work I put together. That's another of those reminders to separate your sense of self/selfishness/attachment to a particular piece of work and to strongly consider what matters most for the consumers of your work.
- When you do research and gather data, how can you measure what people have learned?
- One reminder: if you're interested in visualization, make visualization. AKA, stop talking and start doing, or, the reason my focus during my summer break is on [independent projects](https://trello.com/b/kB50WwrW/project-template).
