Hi, I'm Alexis!

I'm a Data Analyst at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), a company whose [mission](https://teamtreehouse.com/about) is to bring affordable technology education to people everywhere in order to help them achieve their dreams and change the world. How cool is that?

My day-to-day work spans everything from writing SQL queries to experimental analysis and design. I build text-based and customized visual reports and work on building and maintaining models, too.

I started this blog to help keep a record of my effort to improve my knowledge of things like R, statistics and machine learning, and data visualization. I also want it to be a place where I can create helpful resources for other people who are interested in building their data skills.

It's important to me to be involved in my local tech community. After a recent move to Chicago, I'm still figuring out the best ways to do that. In the past some of my favorite work has included serving as a mentor for local technologists, a co-organizer of the [Tech Lady Hackathon](https://technical.ly/dc/2017/10/24/tech-lady-hackathon-2017-recap/), and a [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/) volunteer.

Want to talk code, collaboration, or life in tech? Drop me a line at <readingindata@gmail.com>.
